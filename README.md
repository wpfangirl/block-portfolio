Creates a portfolio post type with 3 custom taxonomies and a Gutenberg block template for single portfolio entries.

## Description

This plugin builds the single portfolio entry from core Gutenberg blocks, arranged in a template to make it easier to create a portfolio of project case studies. Includes two hierarchical taxonomies (project type and client type) and one flat taxonomy (project tag).

This is an extremely rudimentary plugin, created for WordCamp Sacramento 2018.
